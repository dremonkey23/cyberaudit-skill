# CyberAudit

**Know your exposure. Fix what matters.**
*by cybersecurity experts*

CyberAudit runs a local security audit on your machine in seconds. No data leaves your device. No accounts. No cloud. Just an honest look at your security posture.

## What It Checks

| Check | What It Looks For |
|---|---|
| 🔥 Firewall | Is your firewall active? |
| 🔄 Auto-Updates | Are system updates running automatically? |
| 👤 Guest Account | Is a guest account enabled on your machine? |
| 🔌 Open Ports | Are risky ports (RDP, FTP, Telnet, SMB, VNC) exposed? |

## Your Security Score

CyberAudit scores your machine from 0–100 and assigns a letter grade. Each check carries weight — and every risky open port costs you points.

## What You Get

A plain-English report that tells you exactly what's wrong and how to fix it. No jargon. No guessing.
